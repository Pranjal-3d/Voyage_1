PROJECT DEFINITION REPORT (PDR)
VoyageFlow — Interactive Travel Experience Simulator
1. Introduction

The project VoyageFlow is a client-side, interactive travel experience simulator developed using only HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript (ES6+).
The main aim is to create a seamless 4-step journey for a user, starting from registration to travel content exploration, then price calculation, and finally a confirmation page.

The website uses no backend and runs completely on static hosting platforms like GitHub Pages, making it ideal for demonstrating front-end development skills, UI/UX planning, and interactive JavaScript logic.

2. Project Objective

The primary objective of VoyageFlow is to:

Build a four-page travel service simulation using a single HTML file.

Create a smooth, interactive user experience through JavaScript-driven page switching.

Demonstrate skills in form validation, UI navigation, real-time data calculation, and custom modal design without using alerts or backend services.

Showcase an aesthetically pleasing, responsive interface that works on any static server.

3. Scope of the Project

VoyageFlow consists of 4 simulated pages, each designed as a <div> container hidden or shown using JavaScript.

Page 1 — User Registration Form

Purpose: Collect user details and validate them before entry.

Features:

Name, Email, Phone Number, and PIN Code fields

Validation Requirements:

Phone: exactly 10 digits

PIN Code: exactly 6 digits

Email: must follow a standard email format

Real-time or on-submit error messages

Custom success popup (no alert())

Auto-navigation to Page 2 after valid submission

Page 2 — Travel Blog & Destination Showcase

Purpose: Present travel destinations in an engaging scrolling layout.

Features:

Minimum 5 travel blog sections (e.g., Paris, Tokyo, Rome)

Visually styled content blocks with images/text

Sticky navigation bar with clickable tabs

Smooth scrolling via JavaScript or anchor links

A “Next” button at the bottom to go to Page 3

Page 3 — Trip Itinerary & Price Calculator

Purpose: Allow users to choose travel, food, and activity options with real-time total calculation.

Features:

Category sections such as:

Travel Options

Food Packages

Activities

Each option shown with:

checkbox

label

price

JavaScript updates the total price instantly

“Confirm” button opens a modern modal and navigates to Page 4

Page 4 — Confirmation / Thank You Page

Purpose: Provide a polished ending to the user’s simulated journey.

Features:

A visually appealing "Thank You" message

Travel summary (optional)

Social links / restart button

Final consistent design across all pages

4. Technical Requirements
Technology Stack
Component	Technology
Structure	HTML5
Styling	CSS3 / Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
Logic	JavaScript (ES6+)
Hosting	Static Hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages)
Core Technical Constraints

No backend/database

All data must be hardcoded

Only one HTML file with multiple hidden containers

No built-in popups like alert() or prompt()

Custom modals required

Must work both offline (as local file) and online (GitHub Pages)

5. Methodology

UI Planning & Wireframing

Create layout for 4 pages inside one file

Design responsive structure

HTML Development

Build containers for all four pages

Setup forms, blog sections, checkboxes, and confirmation content

CSS Styling

Use Tailwind or custom CSS

Create modals, sticky nav, smooth scrolling effects

JavaScript Logic

Form validation

Page navigation (display: none/block)

Price calculation algorithm

Modal handling

Smooth scrolling logic

DOM updates

Testing

Validate form inputs

Test scrolling/navigation

Check calculations

Check responsiveness on different devices

Deployment

Upload to GitHub

Host on GitHub Pages

Test final functionality

6. Expected Outcome

By completing the VoyageFlow simulator, the following outcomes are expected:

A fully functional, visually cohesive 4-page travel simulation

Working client-side form validation without backend

Smooth navigation and animations

Real-time and accurate total price calculation

Professional custom popups/modals

Deployment-ready static website suitable for academic submission

7. Conclusion

VoyageFlow demonstrates complete understanding of front-end web development fundamentals, including responsive design, JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI/UX design principles.

The project showcases how a multi-page experience can be built in a single static HTML file, making it suitable for lightweight hosting platforms and academic evaluation.
